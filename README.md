# 🛒 Online Market EDA

This project is all about exploring an **online shop sales dataset**.  
I wanted to see how sales change year by year, find the top-performing states, and also check which product sub-categories are growing in California.

## 🔍 What I Did
The idea was simple: take raw data (CSV/Excel), clean it up, work with dates, and then turn it into insights using charts.

- Which 5 states are selling the most?
- Are their sales going up or down each year?
- In California, which product sub-categories are actually increasing?

## ⚙️ Tools I Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel/CSV

## 📊 Key Results
- Total sales per year.
- Top 5 states and their growth across years.
- Sub-category trends in California.
